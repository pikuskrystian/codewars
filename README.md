## Introduction

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an online platform that provides coding challenges (kata) to improve your programming skills. This repository serves as a compilation of my solutions to these challenges, organized by difficulty level and topics.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from the solutions, and contribute your own solutions if you have different approaches!

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is organized to clearly separate and document each problem. Each problem from Codewars or LeetCode is stored in its own dedicated directory. Here's how it works:

    Problem Directory:
    Each problem has its own directory, named after the problem (e.g., two_sum or valid_parentheses).

    Files Inside Each Directory:
        main.cpp: Contains the C++ solution code for the problem.
        readme.md: Includes the problem statement, constraints, and any additional notes or explanations.

Example Directory Structure:

problems/
├── two_sum/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── readme.md
├── valid_parentheses/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── readme.md

How to Use:

    To view the problem statement: Open the readme.md file inside the specific problem's directory.
    To view or run the solution: Open the main.cpp file inside the corresponding directory.

This structure ensures that the code and problem description for each challenge are kept together, making it easy to navigate and understand.
