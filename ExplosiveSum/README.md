Let's break down the exp_sum function step by step:

# Header Files:


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
We include the necessary header files for input/output operations (iostream) and to use the std::vector container (vector) in C++.
```

# Type Alias:

```cpp
using ull = unsigned long long;
```
This line creates an alias ull for the type unsigned long long, which will be used to represent the number of partitions.

# exp_sum Function:

```cpp
ull exp_sum(unsigned int n) {
```

The function exp_sum takes a positive integer n as input and returns the number of partitions of n as an ull (unsigned long long) integer.

# Initializing Vector:
```cpp
std::vector<ull> partitions(n + 1, 0);
```
We create a vector partitions of size n + 1 to store the number of partitions for integers from 0 to n. Initially, all elements are set to 0.

# Base Case:
```cpp
partitions[0] = 1;
```
The number of partitions of 0 is always 1 (the empty partition).

# Dynamic Programming Loop:
```cpp
for (unsigned int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = i; j <= n; ++j) {
        partitions[j] += partitions[j - i];
    }
}
```

We iterate over integers from 1 to n. For each integer i, we consider all numbers from i to n and update the number of partitions for those numbers.
The inner loop updates the number of partitions for j by adding the number of partitions for j - i. This is where dynamic programming is applied to compute the number of partitions efficiently.
Return Result:

```cpp
return partitions[n];
```
We return the number of partitions of the input integer n.

That's how the exp_sum function works to compute the number of partitions for a given positive integer n using dynamic programming.
