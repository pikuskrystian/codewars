### Step by step break down of the code:

## 1 Initialization:
```cpp
string w, out, test;
string alph = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.,? ";
```
- Three strings are declared: w (used for temporary storage), out (the final decoded output), and test (used to store the encoded value for comparison).
- The alph string contains the characters that are being tested during decoding.

## 2 Setting Sizes:
```cpp
int max = p_what.length();
w.resize(max);
out.resize(max);
test.resize(max);
```
- The variable max is set to the length of the input string p_what.
- The resize function is used to resize the strings w, out, and test to the length of p_what.

## 3 Looping Through Alphabets:
```cpp
for (int ii = 0; ii < 67; ii++)
{
    // Set w to the current character of the alphabet
    for (int yy = 0; yy < max; yy++)
        w[yy] = alph[ii];

    // Get the encoding for the current character
    test = Encoder::encode(w);

    // Update out based on the match with test
    for (int yy = 0; yy < max; yy++)
    {
        if (p_what[yy] == '-' && out[yy] != '-')
            continue;  // Skip already modified characters
        if (p_what[yy] == test[yy])
            out[yy] = w[yy];
    }
}
```
-The outer loop iterates through each character in the alph string (67 characters in total).
-The inner loop sets the temporary string w to the current character from alph.
-The Encoder::encode function is called to get the encoded value for the current character, stored in the test string.
-The next inner loop compares each character in p_what with the corresponding character in test.
-If the character in p_what is a hyphen ('-'), and the corresponding character in out is not already modified, it is skipped.
-If the characters in p_what and test match, the corresponding character in out is updated with the character from w.
## 4 Final Output:
```cpp
return out;
```
-The final decoded string out is returned.
## 5 Summary
In summary, the code attempts to decode an input string p_what by iterating through each character in the alph string, encoding it, 
and updating the output string out based on the matching characters with the encoded value. 
The decoding is done by trial and error for each character in the alphabet.
