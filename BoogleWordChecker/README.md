Function Signatures:

The code defines two main functions: isValidCell and isValidGuess, which are helper functions, and the primary function check_word.
isValidCell Function:

isValidCell checks if a given cell (specified by row and column indices) is within the boundaries of the Boggle board and has not been visited.
isValidGuess Function:

isValidGuess is a recursive function that explores all possible paths to find a match for the given word starting from a specific cell.
Base cases are defined to check if the end of the word is reached.
It uses the isValidCell function to ensure that the current cell is within the board boundaries and has not been visited.
Exploration of Adjacent Cells:

The function uses nested loops to explore adjacent cells in a 3x3 neighborhood (including diagonals).
The loops iterate from -1 to 1 in both dimensions to cover adjacent cells.
Backtracking:

Backtracking is implemented by marking the current cell as visited before exploring adjacent cells.
If a valid guess is found in any of the adjacent cells, the function returns true.
After exploring all paths from the current cell, the cell is marked as unvisited (backtrack).
check_word Function:

check_word is the main function that iterates through all cells in the Boggle board.
For each cell, it calls isValidGuess to check if the given word can be formed starting from that cell.
If a valid guess is found starting from any cell, the function returns true.
If no valid guess is found from any cell, the function returns false.
Usage in Main Function (Not Provided):

The main function (not provided in the code) demonstrates the usage of the check_word function with a sample Boggle board and various words.
Complexity Analysis:

The algorithm explores all possible paths from each cell in a recursive manner, resulting in a time complexity that depends on the size of the Boggle board and the length of the word.
Note:

The code focuses on correctness and readability. Depending on specific requirements and constraints, there might be opportunities for optimizations.
